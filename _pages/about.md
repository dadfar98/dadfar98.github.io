Hello! I’m Dadfar, a passionate and curious graduate student with a foundation in Computer Engineering from [Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)](https://www.iust.ac.ir/en).

    ▎ Research Interests:
      - Data Science and Data Mining
      - Graph Analysis
      - Natural Language Processing
      - Software Engineering

In addition to these areas, I am also recently exploring Distributed Systems and Computer Networks.
